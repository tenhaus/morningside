                                        <p>At Morningside College, we believe in helping new students discover how to get the most of everything we have to offer—and out of themselves. That’s why we created the Morningside Mentorship, the first-year advising program that matches you with a personal adviser dedicated to making yours the most rewarding college experience possible.</p>
                                        <p>Every Morningside freshman is assigned a professional Mentor who acts as your personal advocate and informed guide to everything from picking classes and choosing (or changing) your major to connecting you with clubs, organizations, and college resources. Because your Morningside Mentor is focused on your success from day one, you get more out of Morningside.</p>
                                        <p>The Morningside Mentorship offers you all the support and advice you need to make freshman year a great start to a successful college career—no matter what your plans after graduation include. And it’s one more reason more students and families are choosing Morningside College in Sioux City, Iowa.</p>
